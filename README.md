Called the SimplyRETS api first
Saved that data into a transient. For dev purposes only, saving the transient for just a few seconds.
I would imagine real property listings should get refreshed every hour.

Then I saved only the data I needed for the property listings rendering into a properties array.

For rendering, created a templates folder since it was mentioned other pages would be created in this plugin.
Not running FE for quite a while had trouble and googled how to load a template from w/in a plugin instead of the theme.

Having issues loading the script and scss files even though it's already enqueued.

I used the same html template in a replit to mock the styling so far since I couldn't load the scss file.

Added pseudo code for toggling image and saving to localstorage when user clicks on the favorite heart.
Need to add code to remove from localStorage when user un-faves a listing.
